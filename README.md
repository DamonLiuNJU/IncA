IncQuery-MPS
============

An integration between the crux of the EMF-IncQuery engine and the MPS language workbench.

This project aims to create a connection between the EMF-IncQuery project's query engine (which is not EMF specific) and the MPS language workbench by:
* Providing an IncQuery-like pattern language within MPS (as a new extensible language)
* Providing code generators which can then generate IncQuery specific code to utilize the capabilities of the engine.
* Generating similar Java API to the EMF-version, so that clients can use them in their own applications
